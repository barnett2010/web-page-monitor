You can export a task's history checks as a CSV file, which is useful for debugging and auditing.  
You can only export recent 1000 checks of one task, and export once per 15 minutes per task.  

You'd better use Chrome browser to export history and download the CSV file, other browsers may not support this feature.  

## CSV fields (columns) explanation  

_id: this check's id stored in database.  
scheduledTime: The time when this check was scheduled. It is a timestamp in milliseconds.  
consumeTime: The time when this check was consumed. It is a timestamp in milliseconds.  
**finishTime**: The time when this check was finished. It is a UTC Date. (Time Zone: UTC+0)  
**err**: error info from our task executer.  
textHash: The hash of the text of the web page's area.  
**textContent**: The text of the web page's area. (If it is longer than 2000 characters, it will be truncated.)  
taskId: The task (this check belongs to) id.  

the last field: whether checked by our task scheduler.  

:::tip
Care about **finishTime**, it is a UTC Date. (Time Zone: UTC+0).  
Care about **err**, it will show some reasons if one task failed.  
Care about **textContent**, check if this content is the right text you want to monitor. (You can use CSS Selector to select the area / text you care about)
