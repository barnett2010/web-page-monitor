import ImageChanger from "@site/src/components/ImageChanger";  

By using custom mode, you can create a task by writing a piece of Node.js code.  
For example, you can use `node-fetch` to fetch files without html structure, such as txt, json, xml, rss, css, etc.  
Also, you can use `node-fetch` to add header, set cookies, and fetch resources that require login.  
In addition, you can use code to manipulate puppeteer's `page` object, call custom page.evaluate, page.click, and other methods.
Easily simulate clicks, simulate input, set localStorage, etc.


The code snippet is as follows:

```javascript
// cron syntax REQUIRED
export const cronSyntax = '0 0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * *';

// endTime REQUIRED , timestamp , miliseconds
export const endTime = Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7;

// the function to execute a custom mode task. REQUIRED
// taskDetail, page, nodeFetch is available inside below exec() function context
// ignore the editor's hints, YES you can use taskDetail, page, nodeFetch
// taskDetail is an object contains some info about current task
// page is puppeteer's page
// see FAQ and https://docs.webpagemonitor.net for details.
export async function exec(){
  let url = 'https://www.baidu.com';
  let result = await nodeFetch(url).then(r => r.text())
  return result;
}
```

As shown above, you can use Node.js code to create a task with the following rules.  

You must define and export a variable named `cronSyntax`, (string type), which is a cron expression that specifies the time at which the task will be executed each time it is repeated.  
You must define and export a variable named `endTime`, (integer type), which specifies the timestamp of the end of the task (in milliseconds, length thirteen).  
You must define and export a function named `exec`, (async), which executes the specific task logic and returns the result obtained each time.  

You can use the following predefined variables within the exec() function to call some third-party modules when writing custom codes of the task.
- Use the `taskDetail` variable to get the details of the current task. taskDetail contains the following main fields.    

> ```
>{
  _id: "626f6513351d62f9fd567dfb",
  userId: "5e9f8f8f8f8f8f8f8f8f8f8f",
  extra:{
    alias: "task alias name",
  }
}
> ```

- Use the `nodeFetch` variable to call npm's node-fetch module.  
> See [the documentation for node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch).  
> The current version of node-fetch used is 3.2
- Use the `page` variable to call the puppeteer's page object.
> See the [official puppeteer documentation](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/v13.0.1/docs/api.md#class-page)  
> The current version of puppeteer is 13.0.1  

The result of return statement in the exec() function is automatically saved to the database, and an email alert will be sent if the result is changed.  
(Other alerts like keywords appear alert, is under development.)  

:::tip
- Note that the `nodeFetch`, `page`, and `taskDetail` variables can only be used within the function exec().  
- The `require`, `import`, `fetch`, `global`, and `process` keywords cannot be used within the entire code snippet.  
- The maximum length of one code snippet is limited to 5000 chars.  
- Each code snippet is limited to **7 seconds**. If the result is not returned after 7 seconds, the result will be saved as null.  
- Please **return** the obtained string text result within the function exec(), otherwise, there will be no change alert email.  
- You can export the csv file of the current task on the **task list** page to see if the textContent field and the result returned by the exec() function are the results you expect.  
- You don't need to care about the creation and closing of the puppeteer browser instance, just call the methods related to `page`.
